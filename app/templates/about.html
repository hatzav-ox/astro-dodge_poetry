      A web application for tracking space objects is useful for several reasons:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Safety: Knowing the location of space objects can help us avoid collisions
        with them, which is especially important for spacecraft in orbit. Tracking
        space debris can help prevent collisions with active satellites and
        minimize the risk of space junk damaging spacecraft and space stations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scientific Research: Tracking space objects can help scientists better
        understand the dynamics of our solar system and the universe. By
        monitoring the location, speed, and trajectory of asteroids, comets, and
        other objects, researchers can learn more about their composition and
        behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        Astronomy: A web application that allows users to track space objects can
        be useful for amateur and professional astronomers alike. It can help them
        locate and observe specific celestial objects and plan observing sessions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Space Operations: Space agencies and companies can use a web application
        for tracking space objects to monitor the location of their spacecraft and
        ensure they are on course to reach their intended destinations.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Overall, a web application for tracking space objects is useful for
      improving safety, advancing scientific research, supporting astronomy, and
      enhancing space operations.
