      Astro Dodge provides a way for users to find and track Near Earth Objects (NEOs) using
      an intuitive interface. One of its main features is the ability for users to create watchlists of objects that
      they are interested in tracking. By adding an entry to their watchlist, users can track recent NEOs that pass
      within a certain distance of Earth or are otherwise of scientific interest.

      Astro Dodge has implemented an authorization system, where unauthorized users have access to a limited amount of
      objects in the Space List. However, after creating an account, users can access the full Space List without any
      filters applied. To ensure the reliability and stability of the application, comprehensive testing has been
      performed, and a high level of test coverage has been achieved.
